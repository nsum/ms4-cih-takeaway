## Introduction
Welcome,
This Full Stack Web App was made as a 4th Milestone Project with Code Institute.
Hotel I work in was like many others severely impacted by Covid-19 pandemic. 
In efforts to create some revenue, the Hotel started to offer food takeaway service.
At the moment service operates by people calling the hotel's reception and receptionist taking the order over the phone.
This method is not very convenient as receptionists are sometimes unable to take a call or information sometimes gets lost in the process.
Hence the idea for this project. This app would make it easy for people to put in an order, and make it easier for the hotel to process it.
